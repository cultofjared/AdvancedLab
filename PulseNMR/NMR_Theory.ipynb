    "The simpelest way is to look at the *response*. That is when I put a field through the material, what field does it generate? Paramagnets create a field along the external field. Diamagnets oppose the external field. Ferromagnets snap to attention if they are near their critical point. You might do a similar experiment in the ferroelectricity lab.\n",

    "Another way to check out a material is to probe it on the frequency spectrum. Remember that an energy transition is driven by a specific frequency $\\hbar \\omega = \\Delta E$. By sweeping a magnetic field over a range of frequencies, and recording where the material responds, you can map out the set of allowed energy levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortuately this is a difficult experiment. To probe a milli ev energy gap, we will need terrahertz frequency. Also remember that frequency is a vector, so to explore anisotropic (crystaline) samples we would like the ability to rotate the sample. Even if you set up all this, the data you collect can be arbitrarily complicated. Here in 122, we restrict ourselves to considering two level systems, but in the wild we have to think in terms of energy level *density* rather than count."
