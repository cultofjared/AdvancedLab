    "1. A Geiger-Muller tube is coupled to a capacitance of $0.1$ nF. You have adjusted the high voltage so that the G-M tube is operating in the so-called Geiger plateau region. A gamma ray induces an avalanch resulting in the immediate deposition of $10$ billion electrons on the capacitor. The capacitor discharges through a load resistance across which you measure a voltage with your oscilloscope. The pulse decays with a time constant is $RC$ seconds. What is the peak voltage in the pulse?"
