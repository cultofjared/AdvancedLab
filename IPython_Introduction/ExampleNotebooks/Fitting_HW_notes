    get eyes on data as fast as possible.

    might need to fiddle with bin size

    finished plot should have label tweaking

    what do 'error of the mean' and 'error of a count' mean again?

    outlier:
        How far out is it? How far out is it really?
        Does it fit with rest of the distribution? (not really)
        What is it going to contribute to chi squared?
        What happens with all those zero bins?
        What is dangerous about throwing it out after looking at the analysis?

    Why didn't I fit the area?
    Good way to evaluate an analysis - plot the residuals
    what does a good residual plot look like?
    how about a bad one?
    how about this one?


Might come up:
    list comprehension: [stuff(var)
                         for var in list
                         if condition]
