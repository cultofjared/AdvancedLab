We don't really have enough data to establish that the measurements are gaussian, but gaussian is the simplest choice, so we will use it. Norm is scipy's gaussian distribution, we will use cdf, the cumulative distribution function: 

$$\int_{-\infty}^x g(x')dx'$$ 

Remember to multiply the area of the tail by 2.
