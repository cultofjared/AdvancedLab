    "Read Melissinos (2003) chapters 3.2 [Basic electronic equipment], 3.3 [Oscilloscopes and digitizers], and 3.4 [Simple measurements]. Pulses are ubiquitou in timing experiments, in all digital systems (computers, cell phones), and we must use transmission lines (ribbon cable, coaxial cable) to move these pulses from one place to the other. Read the files *Coax impedance* and *Characteristic impedance* on the 122 Electronics Lab web page."

Make a plot of the amplitude of a pulse as a function of position along the transmission line from $0$ to $200$ meters. (The formula is the solution of an elementary differential equation.)"
